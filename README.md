Image Denoising Using AutoEncoders in Keras and Python.

**The project was carried out according to the following steps:**
- (1) Project Overview, 
- (2) Import libraries and datasets, 
- (3) Perform data visualization, 
- (4) Perform data pre-processing, 
- (5) Understand the theory and intuition behind autoencoders, 
- (6) Build and train autoencoder model, 
- (7) Evaluate trained model performance.
